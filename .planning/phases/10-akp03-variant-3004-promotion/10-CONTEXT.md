# Phase 10: AKP03 variant_3004 Promotion - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-05-20
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Mode:** Smart-discuss (autonomous), grey areas accepted as ARCH-grounded defaults

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Promote the `0300:3004` Stream Dock 6-key backend from `scaffolded` to
`functional`: a user with the device plugged in can push `QImage`s to any
LCD key, see real encoder rotate/press/release events, set per-key colour,
set global brightness, clear the device, and flush pending writes. The
`devices.yaml` row stops falsely advertising `clock`.

**Out of this phase:** the per-device USB capture that *confirms* the wire
format (deferred to Phase 9.x) and any non-AKP03 SKU work. This phase
implements against the documented protocol + the Phase 9 default-verdict
ADRs; real-hardware verification is gated behind `AJAZZ_REAL_HARDWARE`.

## Implementation Decisions

### Locked by Phase 9 ADRs (DEFAULT VERDICT — capture-pending)

- **Image pipeline location (ARCH-04):** host-side Qt6 `QImage` resize +
  JPEG encode in `src/devices/streamdeck/src/image_pipeline.{hpp,cpp}`,
  PRIVATE-linked to `ajazz_devices_streamdeck`. Files already exist in
  tree; this phase wires `setKeyImage` through them. **Plan MUST cite the
  conditional status** and gate final acceptance on the Pitfall 22 capture
  matrix (1024-byte chunks + last-chunk Transfer-Done `0x01` + 60×60 JPEG
  Rot0).
- **Clock capability (ARCH-05):** no RTC opcode exists in any AJAZZ corpus
  → `hasClock=false` on `akp03_variant_3004`; `setTime` stays
  `NotImplemented` (v1.1 D-02 honesty contract preserved). Remove `clock`
  from the `devices.yaml` row with a `notes:` line citing ARCH-05.

### Accepted grey-area defaults (2026-05-20)

- JPEG: 60×60, Rot0, quality ~85, `Qt::SmoothTransformation` resize.
  (64×64 Rot90 only applies to the AKP03R rev. 2 lineage — not this SKU.)
- `setKeyColor`: short-circuit by pushing a 1×1 solid-colour JPEG through
  the same image path (no dedicated solid-colour opcode until a capture
  confirms one exists).
- Real-hardware 100-image power-cycle smoke test lives in
  `tests/integration/`, manual, behind the `AJAZZ_REAL_HARDWARE` ctest
  filter — it is the promotion gate, run by an operator, not in CI.

### Claude's Discretion

Error-message wording, chunk-loop structure, and test fixture shapes are at
plan/execution discretion, following existing `akp03.cpp` and sibling-SKU
conventions.

\<code_context>

## Existing Code Insights

- `src/devices/streamdeck/src/akp03.cpp` — backend already implements
  `IDevice`, `IDisplayCapable`, `IEncoderCapable`, `IClockCapable`;
  `setKeyImage` body is currently `NotImplemented`. Encoder
  press/release plumbing already present (`EncoderReleased` at ~line 260 /
  388); the `value=0` half-step workaround is the documented replacement
  target.
- `src/devices/streamdeck/src/image_pipeline.{hpp,cpp}` — already present
  (ARCH-04 Option C target); needs to be the home of the resize+encode+chunk
  logic `setKeyImage` calls.
- `akp03_protocol.hpp` — `PacketSize` migrates 512 → 1024 in one
  load-bearing commit that unblocks the 13 AKP03 sibling SKUs (per-codename
  framing test must cover both sizes during the transition).
- `docs/protocols/streamdeck/akp03.md` — documented wire format (60×60 JPEG
  Rot0 lineage vs 64×64 Rot90 AKP03R r2).
- `docs/_data/devices.yaml` — `akp03_variant_3004` row currently lists
  `capabilities: [display, encoder, clock]`; `clock` is removed here.

**Build precondition:** the C++ build currently fails to configure (Qt6
`CorePrivate` / `qzipreader_p.h` missing — needs `qt6-qtbase-private-devel`).
Execution of this phase is blocked until that is resolved.

\</code_context>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas (ROADMAP success criteria)

1. `PacketSize` 512 → 1024 in one commit; per-codename framing test covers both.
1. `setKeyImage(int keyIndex, QImage)` works on any LCD key via the
   `image_pipeline` host path.
1. `CLE` clear, `setKeyColor` solid-colour short-circuit, `LIG` global
   brightness, explicit `flush` — all four backed by real opcodes.
1. **Promotion gate:** real-hardware 100-image power-cycle smoke test
   (manual, `AJAZZ_REAL_HARDWARE`) passes without hanging the device.
1. Encoder spin delivers a proper `EncoderReleased(int encoderIndex)`
   event, replacing the `value=0` half-step workaround.
1. `devices.yaml` removes `clock`, with a `notes:` line citing ARCH-05.

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- **Phase 9.x capture confirmation** (Pitfall 22 matrix) — finalizes
  ARCH-04 and ARCH-05 from DEFAULT VERDICT to RATIFIED. This phase's plan
  must gate on it.
- **Real-hardware smoke test execution** — requires a physical `0300:3004`
  device; cannot run in CI or this session.
- **Build fix** — Qt6 `CorePrivate` install / mitigation precedes any
  compile or test step here.
